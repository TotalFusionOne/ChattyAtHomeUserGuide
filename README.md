This repository contains the source code for the **Chatty@Home Discord Transition Guide**, a comprehensive resource designed to help members of the old Chatty community transition to our new home on Discord.

**The guide is published and available online at:** [https://totalfusionone.github.io/ChattyAtHomeUserGuide/](https://totalfusionone.github.io/ChattyAtHomeUserGuide/)

## About the Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of everything you need to know about using Discord, specifically tailored for users migrating from a traditional forum environment. It covers topics such as:

*   Setting up Discord (Desktop, Mobile, Browser)
*   Navigating the Discord interface
*   Understanding Channels, Threads, and Forum Channels
*   Communication and notification settings
*   Tips, tricks, and etiquette for using Discord effectively
*   Specific features and customizations for the Chatty@Home Discord server

## Why We Moved to Discord

Our original home had become hostile to several members of our community and, in the spirit of inclusivity, an
invitation was expected to us to use the Chatty@Home Discord to maintain our 25+ year history. You can find more 
information in the section entitled [Bridging the Gap](https://totalfusionone.github.io/ChattyAtHomeUserGuide/bridge.html).
