It's with a mix of sadness and excitement that we embark on this new chapter, leaving behind the familiar halls of our beloved former forum. It wasn't an easy decision, and it's only natural to feel a pang of nostalgia for the place where we shared so many shackbattles, forged friendships, argued endlessly and built a community over the years. That space was more than just a website; it was a digital home, and saying goodbye is bittersweet. But just as we cherished those memories, we also looked ahead, recognizing the need for a platform that could better serve our evolving needs. This move to Discord is the result of careful consideration, driven by a desire to create an even more vibrant and engaging space for us all.

This transition wouldn't have been possible without the tireless efforts of so many dedicated members of our community. Countless hours have been poured into setting up this Discord server, crafting channels, configuring roles, and making it feel like a worthy successor to the forum we held dear. This guide is a testament to their hard work, a labor of love designed to make your transition to Discord as smooth and enjoyable as possible. Within these pages, you'll find everything you need to navigate this new platform, from the basics of getting started to the intricacies of recreating the forum experience we all valued. We'll explore how channels and threads can replace our old forum structure, how to manage notifications, and how to make the most of Discord's unique features. So, while we may have left a familiar place behind, we carry the spirit of our community with us, ready to build something even greater together on Discord. Welcome home!

This guide will be split into two parts: A general Introduction to Discord guide that goes over the every day things you need to know about Discord, and a Chatty@Home specific guide that will introduce you to special additions to our community that have been made.
