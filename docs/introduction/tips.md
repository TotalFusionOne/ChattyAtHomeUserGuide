## Tips, Tricks, and Etiquette

### Discord Etiquette

*   **Be Respectful:** Treat others with the same courtesy and respect you would on our old forum.
*   **Avoid Spamming:** Don't flood channels with unnecessary messages or repeat the same message multiple times.
*   **Use Appropriate Channels:** Keep discussions relevant to the channel topic.
*   **Use Mentions Sparingly:** Only use `@username`, `@here`, or `@everyone` when necessary. Remember that `@everyone` notifies every single person in a channel.
*   **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about something, ask a moderator or another member for assistance.

## Quick Reference Guide

### Glossary of Discord Terms

*   **Channel:** A space for text or voice conversations, organized by topic. (Similar to a sub-forum on the old forum)
*   **Thread:** A sub-conversation within a channel, started from a specific message. (Useful for focused discussions within a broader topic)
*   **Mention:** Using "@" followed by a username or role to notify someone. (Like quoting someone on the forum)
*   **DM (Direct Message):** A private message between two users.
*   **Role:** A set of permissions that can be assigned to users (e.g., moderator, member).
*   **Server:** A community on Discord, made up of channels and members. (Think of this as the equivalent of our entire forum)
*   **Slow Mode:** A channel setting that limits how often users can send messages. (Useful for preventing spam in busy channels)
*   **Pinned Messages:** Messages that are "pinned" to the top of a channel for easy access. (Great for important announcements or frequently referenced information)
*   **Bot:** A program that performs automated tasks on Discord. (We might use bots for various things like moderation, games, or providing helpful information)

### Common Keyboard Shortcuts

*   **Ctrl+K** or **Cmd+K:** Quick Switcher (quickly jump between channels, DMs, or servers)
*   **Ctrl+Shift+K** or **Cmd+Shift+K**: Quick Switcher for DMs only
*   **Ctrl+/** or **Cmd+/**: Show all keyboard shortcuts
*   **Esc:** Mark channel as read
*   **Shift+Esc**: Mark server as read
*   **Alt+Click** on a message: Mark as unread from that message on
*   **Ctrl+P** or **Cmd+P**: See pinned messages

### Notification Settings Cheat Sheet

*   **Mute a Server:** Right-click server icon > Notification Settings > Mute [Server Name]
*   **Mute a Channel:** Right-click channel name > Mute Channel
*   **Change Notification Sound:** User Settings (gear icon) > Notifications > Message Sound
*   **Suppress @everyone and @here:** Right-click server icon > Notification Settings > Suppress @everyone and @here

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   **Can't Hear Audio in Voice Channels:**
    *   Check your audio input/output settings in User Settings > Voice & Video.
    *   Make sure you've selected the correct microphone and speakers.
    *   Try toggling "Automatic Input Sensitivity" on or off.
*   **Messages Not Sending:**
    *   Check your internet connection.
    *   Make sure you're not in a channel with slow mode enabled and have hit the time limit.
*   **Discord App Crashing:**
    *   Try restarting the app.
    *   If that doesn't work, try reinstalling Discord.
    *   Check for updates to the app. Sometimes a bug causing crashes is fixed in a newer version.
*   **Notifications not working:**
    *   Check your OS for a "Focus" or "Do Not Disturb" mode. Some operating systems will disable notifications when these are turned on.
    *   Check your Discord notification settings both globally and for the server you expect to see notifications from.
    *   Make sure your internet connection is stable.
