## Bridging the Gap: Why Discord, and Why It Feels Different

The shift from the familiar threaded Chatty to Discord might feel a bit jarring at first. The Chatty was a place for static, organized discussion where conversations unfolded over time. Discord, on the other hand, is a more dynamic platform, originally designed for real-time communication among gamers. However, don't worry! Discord has evolved, and we can leverage a few of its features features to create a comfortable and engaging space that retains some of the best aspects of the chatty: Its community.

## Key Differences: Forum vs. Discord (High-Level)

Here's a quick rundown of some fundamental differences:

* **Real-time Chat (<img src="{{ '../images/6139-channel-text.png' | relative_url }}" width="14px" height="14px" alt="Discord Channel icon"/>) vs. Threaded Posts (<img src="{{ '../images/5971-forum.png' | relative_url }}" width="14px" height="14px" alt="Discord Forum icon"/>):** Discord's core is real-time chat, which can feel faster-paced than our forum's slower, threaded discussions. However, Discord also offers features like **threads** and **slow mode** to manage the flow of conversation and create focused discussions, similar to forum threads. We'll be exploring these options later on in this guide.
* **Always-on Presence vs. Asynchronous Participation:** Discord shows who's currently online, fostering a sense of immediacy. On the forum, we were used to participating asynchronously, replying whenever we had time. On Discord, you can still participate at your own pace, but you'll also have the option to engage in live conversations. Managing your online status and notifications will be essential and learning how to adjust them to fit your wants is key to not getting annoyed at the format.
* **Notifications:** Discord's notifications can be much more frequent than anything we're used to with the Chatty. Any user can tag any other user and prompt a notification to show. Furthermore, you can have assigned roles that you always get prompted for such as the #StarCitizen or #Sports which can also prompt for a notification.

## So no forum? No threaded modes?

As of the time of writing this guide (December 2024) the answer is *not yet*. There are folks working hard to figure out the best way to create the threaded experience from our previous home either via a single website, a federated site, a CSS overlay for Discord or something else. Head over to the tech forums in Discord to learn more or see how you can contribute.
