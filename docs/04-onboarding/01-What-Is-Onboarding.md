# What is Discord Onboarding?

When you join a new Discord server, you might encounter something called **onboarding**.  Think of it as a guided welcome tour designed to help new members get settled in quickly and easily. Instead of dropping you into a potentially overwhelming sea of channels and conversations, onboarding provides a structured introduction to the community.

## Why Servers Use Onboarding

Servers use onboarding to:

*   **Make New Members Feel Welcome:**  Onboarding provides a friendly and organized way to greet newcomers.
*   **Help You Find Your Way Around:** Instead of being lost in a maze of channels, onboarding helps you find the ones that match your interests.
*   **Introduce You to the Rules:** Onboarding is a chance for you to learn about the server's guidelines and expectations for behavior.
*   **Get You Involved:** By helping you choose channels and participate in initial activities, onboarding encourages you to become an active member of the community.

## Why Chatty@Home Uses Onboarding

Originally, Chatty@Home was a supplemental discord that lived in tandem with our old forum. Over time friends of the community were invited in, groups of players began to form and we grew substantially. By adding an onboarding process we can cut down a lot of channels shown,
making sure you only see the content you want to.

It might seem like an extra barrier to entry, but it's designed to make your experience on a Chatty@Home smoother and more enjoyable. It helps you:

*   **Feel less overwhelmed:** By guiding you through the initial setup, onboarding prevents you from feeling lost or confused.
*   **Connect with your interests:** Channel and role selection lets you tailor your experience to what you care about.
